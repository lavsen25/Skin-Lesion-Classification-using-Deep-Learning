# Skin-Lesion-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

A transfer learning apporach is used for the classification of Skin Lesions. A VGG-16 architecture and weights pre-trained from VGG-model is used for the classification. 
This work was part of Challenge in University of Girona as part of Medical Imaging and Applications(MAIA) course. In the first challenge, the classification is binary task, 
where it is to classify skin lesion images into Benign and Malignant. In the second challenge, the classification is 3 class problem, where the problem is to classify the skin lesion images to 
melanoma vs benign keratosis vs basal cell carcinoma.

The project is carried out in python with Tensorflow framework and Keras API.
